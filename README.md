## Brainstorming (my personal workspace to write out ideas to execute)
### Dad/Mom AI
- fundament: dad enemy occurs more than mom enemy
- dad occurs every 30-35s, walking state for 15s, 5s reaction time/5s door has to be closed/5s walk away
- mom occurs every 70-90s, walking state for 10s, 2s reaction time/5s door has to be open/3s walk away
- maybe oxygen meter since only one threat can be present?
	- oxygen depletes after 60s, 0 to full after 30s
	- dad walks more often, so..
- ok new idea:
	- dad & oxygen are one threat
	- mom stays the same, but laptop has to be turnt off when she is looking during middle phase (5s door has to be open)
